Anomaly Analysis: Cluster 1 from 2020-03-07 21:30:00 to 2020-03-08 07:40:00
Duration: 610.00 minutes

Implicated Variables and Z-Scores:
Cyclone_Material_Temp: 6.60, Cyclone_Outlet_Gas_draft: 3.61

Variable Changes:
Cyclone_Material_Temp decreased slightly by 7.65% during the anomaly
  Before mean: 699.32
  During mean: 645.79
  After mean: 847.49

Cyclone_Outlet_Gas_draft decreased slightly by 0.94% during the anomaly
  Before mean: -299.74
  During mean: -296.92
  After mean: -302.61

Root Cause Hypothesis:
A sudden decrease in Cyclone_Material_Temp coincided with a decrease in Cyclone_Outlet_Gas_draft, which suggests an operational anomaly that may require further investigation of upstream processes or control parameters.
