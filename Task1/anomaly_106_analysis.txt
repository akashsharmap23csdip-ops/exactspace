Anomaly Analysis: Cluster 1 from 2018-05-20 13:45:00 to 2018-05-20 20:20:00
Duration: 395.00 minutes

Implicated Variables and Z-Scores:
Cyclone_Gas_Outlet_Temp: 6.12, Cyclone_Inlet_Draft: 2.72

Variable Changes:
Cyclone_Gas_Outlet_Temp decreased moderately by 31.22% during the anomaly
  Before mean: 745.60
  During mean: 512.85
  After mean: 817.64

Cyclone_Inlet_Draft increased slightly by 2.91% during the anomaly
  Before mean: -213.11
  During mean: -219.31
  After mean: -223.47

Root Cause Hypothesis:
A sudden decrease in Cyclone_Gas_Outlet_Temp coincided with a increase in Cyclone_Inlet_Draft, which suggests a potential thermal imbalance affecting pressure conditions, possibly due to upstream process changes or partial blockage.
