Anomaly Analysis: Cluster 1 from 2020-03-07 15:00:00 to 2020-03-07 21:00:00
Duration: 360.00 minutes

Implicated Variables and Z-Scores:
Cyclone_Material_Temp: 6.64, Cyclone_Outlet_Gas_draft: 3.55

Variable Changes:
Cyclone_Material_Temp decreased moderately by 28.09% during the anomaly
  Before mean: 891.79
  During mean: 641.25
  After mean: 686.76

Cyclone_Outlet_Gas_draft decreased slightly by 0.11% during the anomaly
  Before mean: -295.95
  During mean: -295.64
  After mean: -302.23

Root Cause Hypothesis:
A sudden decrease in Cyclone_Material_Temp coincided with a decrease in Cyclone_Outlet_Gas_draft, which suggests an operational anomaly that may require further investigation of upstream processes or control parameters.
