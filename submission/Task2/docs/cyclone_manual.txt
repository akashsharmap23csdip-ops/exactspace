# Cyclone Operation Manual

## Introduction

A cyclone is a device that uses centrifugal force to separate particles from a gas stream. It consists of an inlet, a cylindrical section, a conical section, and an outlet.

## Operating Parameters

### Temperature

The cyclone inlet gas temperature should be maintained between 300°C and 450°C for optimal operation. If the temperature drops below 300°C, incomplete combustion may occur, leading to increased emissions. If the temperature exceeds 450°C, thermal damage to the cyclone lining may occur.

### Pressure

The cyclone inlet draft should be maintained between -150 mmWG and -130 mmWG. A sudden drop in draft may indicate a blockage or a leak in the system. Conversely, a sudden increase in draft (becoming less negative) might indicate a draft control issue.

### Material Flow

The material temperature should be monitored closely. A high material temperature (>380°C) might indicate excessive heat transfer from the gas, which could affect downstream equipment.

## Troubleshooting

### Scenario 1: Sudden Draft Drop

If there is a sudden drop in cyclone inlet draft (becoming more negative), check for:
1. Partial blockage in downstream equipment
2. Improper fan operation
3. Changes in upstream process conditions

### Scenario 2: High Outlet Temperature

If the cyclone gas outlet temperature is abnormally high:
1. Check for reduced material flow
2. Verify the inlet gas temperature
3. Inspect refractory lining for damage

## Maintenance

Regular maintenance should be performed weekly to ensure optimal operation. This includes:
1. Inspection of the cyclone body for wear
2. Checking the draft gauge for proper functioning
3. Calibration of temperature sensors
