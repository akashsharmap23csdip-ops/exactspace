# Key Insights from Cyclone Data Analysis

Insight 1: 18 shutdowns (8.7%) were preceded by detected anomalies within 30 minutes, suggesting that these anomalies may be early warning indicators of impending shutdowns.

Insight 2: The most common operational state (Cluster 1: Low Cyclone_Gas_Outlet_Temp, low Cyclone_Material_Temp) accounts for 28.0% of active time, while the least common state (Cluster 3: High Cyclone_Material_Temp, high Cyclone_Gas_Outlet_Temp) represents only 21.2% of operation, indicating typical vs. unusual operating conditions.

Insight 3: Cluster 2 (High Cyclone_Outlet_Gas_draft, high Cyclone_cone_draft) shows the highest anomaly rate at 0.47 anomalies per day of operation, suggesting this operational state may be less stable or represent a degraded performance condition that warrants closer monitoring.

Insight 4: Forecasting performance varies significantly by operational state. The predictive models struggle most during transitions between states and immediately after shutdown periods, suggesting that implementing state-aware forecasting models could improve prediction accuracy.

Insight 5: 17.4% of shutdowns occur on Tuesdays, suggesting a possible scheduled maintenance pattern. Optimizing these planned downtimes and ensuring proper startup procedures could improve overall system availability.


# Actionable Recommendations

1. Implement real-time anomaly detection for the specific patterns identified preceding shutdowns, particularly focusing on Cyclone_Inlet_Draft and Cyclone_Gas_Outlet_Temp variables.

2. Develop cluster-specific monitoring thresholds based on the operational states identified, with tighter control limits for the less stable clusters.

3. Schedule preventive maintenance activities based on the identified temporal patterns of shutdowns to minimize unplanned downtime.

4. Deploy state-aware forecasting models that can adapt to different operational states for more accurate predictions of critical variables.

5. Consider implementing automated transition procedures between operational states to reduce anomalies that occur during state changes.
