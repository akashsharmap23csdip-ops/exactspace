# Cyclone Troubleshooting Guide

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. Low Separation Efficiency

**Symptoms:**
- Increased dust emissions
- Reduced collection rate
- Visible particles in gas outlet

**Potential Causes:**
- Inlet velocity too low
- Cyclone diameter too large for particle size
- Wear in cyclone body
- Leakage at seals

**Solutions:**
- Verify fan operation and inlet velocity (should be 15-25 m/s)
- Check for worn areas in the cyclone body and repair as needed
- Inspect and replace damaged seals
- Consider installing a smaller diameter cyclone for fine particles

### 2. Pressure Drop Issues

**Symptoms:**
- Abnormal draft readings
- Reduced throughput
- Inconsistent separation

**Potential Causes:**
- Material buildup in cone section
- Partial blockage in outlet
- Improper inlet configuration
- Damaged or worn components

**Solutions:**
- Inspect and clean cone section
- Check outlet for blockages
- Verify inlet dimensions and alignment
- Replace worn components

### 3. Temperature-Related Problems

**Symptoms:**
- Fluctuating temperature readings
- Material sticking to walls
- Condensation in outlet

**Potential Causes:**
- Operating below dew point
- Improper insulation
- Faulty temperature sensors
- Upstream process variations

**Solutions:**
- Maintain temperature above dew point (typically >150°C)
- Verify insulation integrity
- Calibrate or replace temperature sensors
- Stabilize upstream process conditions

## Emergency Procedures

### Sudden Draft Surge

If draft suddenly becomes less negative (>-100 mmWG):
1. Check for breach in cyclone body
2. Verify fan operation
3. Inspect for material buildup causing flow restrictions
4. Reduce inlet flow rate until issue is resolved

### High Temperature Alarm

If temperature exceeds 500°C:
1. Reduce inlet flow immediately
2. Check upstream combustion process
3. Inspect refractory lining
4. Verify cooling systems are operational

## Preventive Maintenance

### Daily Checks
- Monitor pressure drop across cyclone
- Record inlet and outlet temperatures
- Inspect visible portions for dust buildup

### Weekly Tasks
- Calibrate pressure sensors
- Check seals and flanges for leaks
- Verify fan performance

### Monthly Procedures
- Inspect cyclone internals for wear
- Clean cone section
- Check structural supports
- Analyze collection efficiency
